# Basic Syntax and Structure

The basic structure of a C program consists of a series of statements organized within functions. Each C program must contain a `main()` function, which serves as the entry point for program execution. The `main()` function typically calls other functions to perform specific tasks.

**Key Components of C Program Structure:**

1. **Header Files:** C programs include header files like `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>` to access standard input/output functions and memory management functions.
2. **`main()` Function:** The `main()` function is the starting point of a C program and contains the code to be executed when the program is run.
3. **Statements:** C programs consist of statements that perform specific actions like variable declarations, assignments, control flow, and function calls.
4. **Syntax Rules:** C programs follow syntax rules like ending statements with a semicolon (`;`), enclosing code blocks within curly braces (`{}`), and using proper indentation for readability.

Understanding the basic syntax and structure of C programs is essential for writing correct and well-organized code.

# Data Types and Variables

Data types in C define the type of data that can be stored in variables and the operations that can be performed on them. C provides various primitive data types like `int`, `float`, `char`, and modifiers like `long` and `short` to represent different kinds of data.

**Common Data Types in C:**

1. **Primitive Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `void`, `bool`
2. **Modifiers:** `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, `long`
3. **Constants:** `const`, `#define`
4. **Enumerations:** `enum`

**Key Concepts in Data Types:**

- **Primitive Data Types:** Represent basic data types like integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and void (no value).
- **Modifiers:** Alter the properties of data types, such as signedness, size, and range.
- **Constants:** Define fixed values that cannot be modified during program execution.
- **Enumerations:** Define a set of named integer constants for better code readability.

Understanding data types and variables is crucial for managing data effectively and ensuring proper memory allocation in C programs.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age = 30; // Integer data type
    float height = 5.8; // Floating-point data type

    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    printf("Height: %.1f\n", height);

    return 0;
}
```

# Operators in C

Operators in C are symbols that represent specific operations like addition, subtraction, comparison, and logical operations. C provides a wide range of operators, including arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, assignment, ternary, and increment/decrement operators.

**Common Operators in C:**

| Operator Type | Symbols | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Arithmetic | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | Basic mathematical operations and modulus |
| Logical | `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` | AND, OR, NOT operations for boolean values |
| Relational | `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Compare values and return boolean results |
| Bitwise | `&`, `\|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>` | Bit-level operations on integers |
| Assignment | `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` | Assign and modify variable values |
| Ternary | `condition ? expr1 : expr2` | Shorthand for if-else statements |
| Increment/Decrement | `++`, `--` | Add or subtract 1 from a value |

Understanding operators in C is essential for performing various operations on data and controlling program flow effectively.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10, b = 5;
    int sum = a + b; // Arithmetic operator
    int result = (a > b) ? a : b; // Ternary operator

    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

# Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements in C are used to control the flow of program execution based on certain conditions or loops. C provides various control flow statements like `if`, `else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`, `break`, and `continue` to manage program flow effectively.

**Common Control Flow Statements in C**

1. **`if` Statement:**  
    Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         int age = 20;
    
         if (age >= 18) {
              printf("You are an adult.\n");
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

2. **`else` Statement:**  
    Executes a block of code if the `if` condition is false.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         int age = 16;
    
         if (age >= 18) {
              printf("You are an adult.\n");
         } else {
              printf("You are a minor.\n");
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

3. **`switch` Statement:**  
    Evaluates an expression and executes the corresponding case block.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         int choice = 2;
    
         switch (choice) {
              case 1:
                    printf("Choice 1 selected.\n");
                    break;
              case 2:
                    printf("Choice 2 selected.\n");
                    break;
              default:
                    printf("Invalid choice.\n");
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

4. **`while` Loop:**  
    Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         int i = 1;
    
         while (i <= 5) {
              printf("%d\n", i);
              i++;
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

5. **`for` Loop:**  
    Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
              printf("%d\n", i);
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

6. **`do-while` Loop:**  
    Executes a block of code at least once and then repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         int i = 1;
    
         do {
              printf("%d\n", i);
              i++;
         } while (i <= 5);
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

7. **`break` Statement:**  
    Exits the loop or `switch` statement.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
              if (i == 5) {
                    break;
              }
              printf("%d\n", i);
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

8. **`continue` Statement:**  
    Skips the current iteration of a loop.
    
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    
    int main() {
         for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
              if (i == 3) {
                    continue;
              }
              printf("%d\n", i);
         }
    
         return 0;
    }
    ```

Understanding control flow statements is essential for implementing decision-making and looping logic in C programs.

# Functions in C
# Functions in C

Functions in C are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called from other parts of the program. They provide a modular approach to programming, allowing developers to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.

**Key Concepts in Functions**

1. **Function Declaration:**  
    Specifies the function name, return type, and parameters (if any). It informs the compiler about the function's name and how to call it.

     ```c
     // Function Declaration
     int add(int a, int b);
     ```

2. **Function Definition:**  
    Contains the actual code that defines the function's behavior.

     ```c
     // Function Definition
     int add(int a, int b) {
          return a + b;
     }
     ```

3. **Function Calling:**  
    Invokes the function to execute its code and return a result (if any).

     ```c
     int sum = add(10, 20); // Function Calling
     ```

4. **Arguments:**  
    Values passed to a function when it is called. They can be passed by value or by reference.

5. **Recursion:**  
    A function that calls itself to solve a problem iteratively.

**Example of a Function in C:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function Declaration
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
     int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
     int sum = add(num1, num2); // Function Calling

     printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);

     return 0;
}

// Function Definition
int add(int a, int b) {
     return a + b;
}
```

Functions play a crucial role in structuring C programs and promoting code reusability and maintainability.


# Pointers

Pointers in C are variables that store memory addresses, allowing direct access to memory locations and efficient memory management. They are used to store the address of variables, arrays, and functions, enabling dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.

**Key Concepts in Pointers:**

1. **Pointer Basics:**  
    Declaring and initializing pointers to store memory addresses.

     ```c
     int *ptr; // Pointer Declaration
     int num = 10;
     ptr = &num; // Pointer Initialization

        printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr); // Dereferencing Pointer
        ```
2. **Pointer Arithmetic:**
    Performing arithmetic operations on pointers to navigate memory locations.

     ```c
     int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
     int *ptr = arr;

     printf("Element: %d\n", *ptr); // Accessing Array Element
     ptr++; // Moving to Next Element
     printf("Element: %d\n", *ptr);
     ```
3. **Pointer to Pointer:**
    Storing the address of a pointer in another pointer.

     ```c
     int num = 10;
     int *ptr = &num;
     int **pptr = &ptr;

     printf("Value: %d\n", **pptr); // Dereferencing Pointer to Pointer
     ```
4. **Void Pointers:**
    Generic pointers that can store the address of any data type.

     ```c
     void *ptr;
     int num = 10;
     ptr = &num;
     ```
5. **Pointers with Arrays:**
    Using pointers to access array elements and manipulate array data.

     ```c
     int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
     int *ptr = arr;

     for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
          printf("Element: %d\n", *(ptr + i));
     }
     ```
6. **Pointers with Functions:**
    Passing pointers as function arguments to modify values outside the function.

     ```c
     void increment(int *num) {
          (*num)++;
     }

     int main() {
          int value = 10;
          increment(&value);
          printf("Value: %d\n", value);
          return 0;
     }
     ```
Pointers are a powerful feature of C that enables efficient memory management, dynamic data structures, and direct access to hardware resources.
