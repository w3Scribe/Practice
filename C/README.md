## How to Use
1. Open the `app.c` file to view or edit the C program.
2. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc app.c -o app.exe`).
3. Run the compiled program using `app.exe`.

## Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the C programs, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the directory containing the C file (e.g., `app.c`).
2. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```sh
   gcc app.c -o app.exe
