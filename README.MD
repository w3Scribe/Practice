## Languages Covered

- **C**: Basic programs, algorithms, and more.
- **Go**: Practice files and examples.
- **Python**: Basic programs, algorithms, and other learning resources.
- **TypeScript**: Examples and practice code.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/w3Scribe/Practice.git
  ```

2. **Navigate to the Language Folder**: Go to the folder of the language you want to practice (e.g., `cd Practice/Python`).

3. **Open the Main File**: Each language folder contains a main file (e.g., `app.py` for Python, `app.go` for Go).

4. **Run the Code**: Follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` file within each language folder to run the code.

## Prerequisites

- **C**: GCC compiler or any C compiler.
- **Go**: Go runtime installed ([golang.org](https://golang.org/)).
- **Python**: Python installed ([python.org](https://python.org/)).
- **TypeScript**: Node.js and Bun installed ([bun.sh](https://bun.sh)).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/w3Scribe/Practice.git
  ```

2. **Navigate to the Desired Language Directory**:
  ```bash
  cd Practice/<language>
  ```

3. **Follow the Instructions in the Language-Specific `README.md`**: Each language directory has its own `README.md` with specific instructions on how to run the code.
